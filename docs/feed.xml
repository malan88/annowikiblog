        <title>Fixing a few bugs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;This place is a ghost town.&lt;/span&gt;  But only for now. I am almost
done fixing the minor tweaks before I start inviting beta users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom links are no longer dead. I have set up this blog (obviously) and
created static pages for Terms, Contact, and About on this annowiki.blog. I
don’t see any reason to use anno.wiki to create thouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created a twitter but haven’t started using it yet. I will be creating a
Mastadon, Facebook, and god knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the indexing system under control. There is one minor tweak I need to
make to annotation edits in the back end (a database adjustment) which will be
the first database migration I will ever do live. I want to do it before I start
inviting people. It will consolidate a lot of gains I made two weeks ago before
I launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also still need to fix the stylistic flubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this will be done in the next week. Then I will invite more users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's Alive!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://anno.wiki&quot;&gt;anno.wiki&lt;/a&gt; is now live!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;It is currently in beta mode,&lt;/span&gt;  which means registration is only possible with a
magic link I can send out. I will start inviting more people as I get more of
the baubles done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the bottom links, one of which links here, are still mostly dead.
This has to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the twitter in the course of making this blog, but haven’t done
anything on it yet. Unsure if I want to create a Mastadon and/or a Facebook. I
am more inclined toward Mastadon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gotten the email system working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still indexing lines. Holy cow is that slow. Turns out there’s a bulk_index
function to do what I’m doing but I totally am already ¾ of the way
through indexing so it’s a little late for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some styling flubs in the pages. Especially for mobile. Verse
gets concatenated the same as everything and, even worse, when everything gets
concatenated on mobile, the paragraph separations disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to set up ssl for the main url, anno.wiki. For now that means secure
connections are only available via &lt;a href=&quot;https://annowiki.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;annowiki.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;. That won’t be for
long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://annowiki.blog&quot;&gt;annowiki.blog&lt;/a&gt; to point to /docs in the text-processing repo, but now
I have to try to set that up with this annowikiblog repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this first post is a breathless one. Somewhat of a Mission Accomplished
moment. Because anno.wiki is far from live.&lt;/p&gt;
