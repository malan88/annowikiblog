{% newthought 'This place is a ghost town.' %} But only for now. I am almost
done fixing the minor tweaks before I start inviting beta users.

The bottom links are no longer dead. I have set up this blog (obviously) and
created static pages for Terms, Contact, and About on this annowiki.blog. I
don't see any reason to use anno.wiki to create thouse.

I have created a twitter but haven't started using it yet. I will be creating a
Mastadon, Facebook, and god knows what else.

I have the indexing system under control. There is one minor tweak I need to
make to annotation edits in the back end (a database adjustment) which will be
the first database migration I will ever do live. I want to do it before I start
inviting people. It will consolidate a lot of gains I made two weeks ago before
I launched.

I also still need to fix the stylistic flubs.

All this will be done in the next week. Then I will invite more users.
